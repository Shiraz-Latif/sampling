Quality   checks were performed to ensure consistency and data errors including data,   date of birth etc through CATI program. Later, imputations were also   performed for missing data.  | The datasets   were pre-processed by cleaning out any respondents who provided incomplete   responses to initial demographics or the core survey, took the survey twice,   completed either wave of the survey in less than 8.5 minutes,   “straight-lined” multiple grid questions (“straightliners”) or provided a   postal code not matching their province. | Collected   sequences were edited using Sequencher v.4.5 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor MI, USA)   and were manually aligned in BioEdit v.7.0.9 (Ibis BioSciences, Carlsbad, CA,   USA). A neighbour-joining tree of recovered sequences was constributed using   the K2P parameter using MEGA v.4. <br>                                        |   |
