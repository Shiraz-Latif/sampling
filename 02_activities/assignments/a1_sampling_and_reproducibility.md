# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 1000 (from the original 50000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitbyâ€™s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. 
==================================================================
Sampling used in the code: 
There are three places where sampling is used in the code. 
1. To randomly identify infected people 
    This is a purely random sampling with sample space of the people who attended either wedding (200) or a brunch (800). Sample size for this is kept at 10% of the total population. The distibution of numpy random() is uniform normal distribution. 

2. To randomnly identify contact tracing (primary)
    The sample space for this is the subset of population who are identified as infected. 
    The sample size is kept as 20% (Trace success) 


3. To randomly identify contact tracing (secondary)
    The sample space for this is the subset of population who are identified and traced  
    The sample size is kept as 2

Comment on Reproducibility 
==================================================================
No, re-running the code doesn't generate the same graph because of the randomness of the sampled subset of population generated in the code. The sampling is pure random sampling without any grouping i.e. no stratefied sampling is performed to keep the proportion of the traced cases in a particular ratio. 


Reproducibility for Random Experiments: 
==================================================================
    In order to ensure reproducibility in the simulation, it is important to set the seed before the use of any function that is used for sampling. For this particular code, I moved the random seed to the section before the function definition simulate_event. 
    Setting the seed at the start will initialize the random number generator with a specific starting point, allowing  to reproduce the same sequence of random values each time the code is executed.
